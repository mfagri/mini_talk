# Minitalk
communication program in the form of a client and a server
**PROJECT Instruction :**

- you have to turn in a Makefile which will compile your source files . it must not relink.
- you have to handle errors thoroughly in no way your program should quit unexpectedly (segmentation fault , bus error, double free, and so forth).
- your program mustnâ€™t have memory leaks .
- you can have on global variable per program ( one for the client and one for the server ), but you will have to justify their use .
- in order to complete the mandatory part you are allowed to use the following function
- functionâ€™s
    
    â—¦ write
    â—¦ ft_printf and any equivalent YOU coded
    â—¦ signal
    â—¦ sigemptyset
    â—¦ sigaddset
    â—¦ sigaction
    â—¦ kill
    â—¦ getpid
    â—¦ malloc
    â—¦ free
    â—¦ pause
    â—¦ sleep
    â—¦ usleep
    â—¦ exit
    

### Mandatory part :

you must create a communication program in the form of a client and a server .

- the server must be started first . After its launch . it has to print it **PID**
- **the client take two parameters**
1. The server PID 
2. The string to send

- The client must send the string passed as a parameter to the server once the string has been received the server must print it .
- The server has to display the string pretty quickly , Quickly means that if you think it takes too long then it is probably too long

### tip:

1 s for displaying 100 characters is way too much !

- your server should be able to receive string from serval clients in row without needing to restart.
- The communication between your client and your server has to be done only using UNIX signals .
- You can only use these two signals : **SIGUSR1 SIGUSR2**
# code :

## 1st Step make server receive a signal from client :

in MINItalk there are two processes/programs : the client and the server . what the project consists of is the communication between both processes more precisely . more precisely the client process sends a message string to the process whose id was given as parameter -server

The first logical step i took while doing the project was to make the first connection between both programs so i made client send a signal to server sigusr1 by using the kill() command 

by using the function getpid() i managed to get the process ID of the server program i want to send a signal to. this is what happens when you execute server :

```c
-> Minitalk git :(main)  ~ ./server
PID: 12750 
```

the client will then receive the serverâ€™s pid and by using the kill() command will send a signal - SIGUSR1 to the server you exectue client like this :

 

```c
-> MiniTalk git : (main) ./client 12750
```

then just like that the server receives a signal and outputs  a message to the shell 

```c
-> Minitalk git : (main) ~ ./server
PID :12750
signal 10 received.
```

what happens is that client.c file use signal() and when it receives SIGUSR1 it sends it to a function called handler_sigusr1 that outputs a success message . The server program then continues running , waiting for more  SIGUSR1 signals until the user stops it - CTRl + c  .

if instead of an infinite while loop the program used the pause() function . After receiving and handling the signal the server would terminate on its own .
CODE : 

```c
//client.c
int main(int argc,char **argv)
{
	int pid;
	
	if (argc!= 2)
		{
			ft_printf("client : invalid arguments\n");
				exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
		}
	pid = atoi(argv[1]);
	kill(pid, SIGUSR1);
	return(0);
}
```

```c
//server.c
void handler_sigusr1(int signum)
{
	printf("signal %d received.\n", signum);
}
int main(void)
{
	pid_t pid;
	pid = getpid();
	ft_printf("PID:%d",pid);
	signal(SIGUSR1, handler_igusr1);
	while (1)
		pause();
} 
```

## 2nd step : convert ASCII character to Binary character

ASCII stands for American standard Code for information interchange and its a way to represent text in a computer . The ASCII table represents all the 127 ASCII characters and their values . That means that every character is represented by number ..

The way two programs can communicate via signals more precisely SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 - is to make them represent a binary value each  in this case we consider that SIGUSR represent 1 and SIGUSR2  represents 0. so when we send a SIGUSR1 signal we are sending 1 to server and by sending  SIGUSR2 signal we are sending 0 .

This second step is focused on getting all the bits from a character - 8 bits in ASCII - this means that server will need to receive 8 signals from client for every ASCII character .

so guys i did use bits shifting operation i do really want u to search about it before u read that it can be a little be complicated so , first of all  we have 3 operator **& | ^** : the and or and Xor 
soo every want of them has her own operations like for example & :

> 0 & 1 = 0;
1 & 1 = 1;
0 & 0 = 0;
> 

Or is way more different :

> 0 | 1  = 1 
0| 0  = 0
1 | 1  = 1
> 

Xor :

> 1 ^ 1 : 0
1 ^ 0 : 1
1 ^ 1 : 0
> 

so this the operation that u will see in this document letâ€™s see so we want send character as a signal so first of all that character should be in binary we will use & , for example we have the **a** character  ****in binary which is 01000001 it will be compared with 128 which is 10000000 ,This operator will return a **0,** if the first bit of that character is zero, and it will return **128** if the first bit is one, then the program wonâ€™t use 128 instead he will use 64 that is (01000000) this will enable the program to get the second left character .

```c
//client.c 
#include "minitalk.h"

void	convert_to_binary(int pid, char *s)
{
	int	i;
	int	bit;

	i = 0;
	if (!s)
		exit(1);
	while (1)
	{
		bit = -1;
		while (++bit < 9)
		{
			if (s[i] & (128 >> bit))
			{
				if (kill(pid, SIGUSR1) == -1)
					exit(1);
			}
			else
				if (kill(pid, SIGUSR2) == -1)
					exit(1);
			usleep(300);
		}
		if (!s[i])
			break ;
		i++;
	}
}
```

## 3rd step how to convert from binary to ascii :

so first. of all client can send signals to server which he can receive it ,and now since the client is able to decide whose to send sigusr1 or sigusr2 itâ€™s up to the server to convert those character back to an ascii character .

so now weâ€™re going to work with this two bitwise operator **^ and |**  

so now instead of starting with the value 0 , we will initialize a variable with 0xFF 255 in decimal which is : 11111111 in binary max value  .

so if he found sigusr2 (1) we will use the or operator else ^ will be used 

and after that when the bit = 8 we will put the character and reinitialize the two variables .

our code will be like:

```c
//server.c 

void	binary_to_ascii(int signum, siginfo_t *info, void *context)
{
	static int	g_pid = 0;
	static char	c = 0xFF;
	static int	bit = 0;	

	(void) context;
	if (g_pid != info->si_pid)
	{
		c = 0xFF;
		bit = 0;
		g_pid = info->si_pid;
	}
	if (signum == SIGUSR1)
		c |= 0x80 >> bit;
	else if (signum == SIGUSR2)
		c ^= 0x80 >> bit;
	if (bit++ == 8)
	{
		if (!c)
			fmsg(g_pid, SIGUSR1);
		ft_putchar(c);
		bit = 0;
		c = 0xFF;
	}
}
```

## 4 step : sending string from client to server :

 so this the final step itâ€™s not a big deal we just should mesure the len of the string that we want send it and in the send signals function weâ€™re going to increase until it equal it itâ€™s an easy thing.
